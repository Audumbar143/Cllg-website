        <p><b> In 1926, British wizard and "magizoologist" Newton "Newt" Scamander arrives in New York City. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, the non-magical ("No-Maj" or "Muggle") head of the New Salem Philanthropic Society, who preaches that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. Attempting to recapture a Niffler that escaped from his suitcase of magical creatures, Newt meets No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, an aspiring baker, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Porpentina "Tina" Goldstein, a demoted Auror of the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), arrests Newt for breaking magical law. Since the suitcase in his possession only contains Jacob's baked goods, Newt is released, much to Tina's embarrassment. At home, Jacob opens Newt's suitcase, inadvertently freeing several creatures into the city.</b></p>
